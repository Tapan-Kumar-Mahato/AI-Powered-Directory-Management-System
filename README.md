# AI-Powered-Directory-Management-System
The AI-Powered Directory Management System is an intelligent and automated solution designed to streamline the organization and management of files and directories. This system leverages AI algorithms to perform key tasks such as automatic file sorting, duplicate file detection and removal, directory cleanup, and generating AI-based insights to optimize storage usage. It categorizes files based on type (e.g., documents, images, videos) and allows users to set custom rules to match specific organizational preferences. The system also detects unused or empty folders and provides recommendations on rarely accessed or obsolete files. Easy to set up and use, the tool requires Python (version 3.8 or higher) and a few dependencies, which can be installed using the included requirements.txt file. With just a few steps, users can launch the system, select a directory to manage, and apply actions like file organization, duplicate removal, and cleaning. The tool's behavior can be customized through a config.json file, enabling flexible file handling according to user needs. Future enhancements include integration with cloud storage services, real-time notifications for large or newly added files, and a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI).
